# UFO's

Purpose:
The purpose of the analysis is to create a webpage design and tables using data collected from a data.js file. The website houses information from sightings of UFO's from specific dates and places. The data structure allows for filtering of data through an HTML file as well as a Javascript file. Through the website, multiple filters were able to be made from city, state, shape, country and date. The sources used for the completed challenge were Javascript (JS), index.htm (HTML), and VS Code. 

Results:
From the UFO Finder HMTL, the results were drawn based upon using a console webpage through an inspect tab that allowed for proper webscraping to happen. The website was designed through a sort of blueprint storyboard that allowed for different elements to be made. Different filters were made to help understand the elements and the webpage design to navigate through the html file. Majority of the project was readily easy to read and understand through proper steps and documentation. The only con of the HTML and JavaScript file were that some dates were not easy to access and there was a lot of information to sort from.
